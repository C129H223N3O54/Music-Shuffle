## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Spotify Premium** account (required for Web Playback SDK)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- A free [Spotify Developer App](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Any web server that can serve static files over **HTTPS**

> ⚠️ Spotify OAuth requires HTTPS — `http://localhost` is the only exception for local development.

---

### Step 1 — Create a Spotify Developer App

1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click **"Create app"**
3. Enter a name and description
4. Add your **Redirect URI** (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/` or `http://localhost:8080/`)
5. Enable **Web API** and **Web Playback SDK**
6. Click **Save** and copy your **Client ID**

> After deploying, go back and add your production Redirect URI too.

---

### Step 2 — Add yourself as a test user

In your Spotify App → **Settings** → **User Management** → add your Spotify email address.

> Required for Development Mode. Spotify currently allows up to 5 users per app.

---

### Step 3 — Deploy the files

Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-shuffle.git
cd music-shuffle
```

Copy and edit the config file:

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
```

Edit `config.js`:

```javascript
window.SPOTIFY_CONFIG = {
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',
    redirectUri: 'https://your-domain.com/',
    syncUrl: null, // optional — see sync-server/SYNC-SERVER.md
};
```

Upload all files to your web server. The app is entirely static — no build step required.

---

### Step 4 — Local development

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node.js
npx serve . -p 8080

# PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

Set `redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/'` in `config.js` and add `http://localhost:8080/` in your Spotify Dashboard.

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

---

### Step 5 — Open the app and log in

1. Open the app URL in your browser
2. Enter your Client ID (if not set in `config.js`)
3. Click **"Mit Spotify einloggen"**
4. Authorize the app
5. Start shuffling 🎲

## 🌐 Deployment Options

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Any VPS/server | Copy files to web root (Apache, Nginx, Caddy) |
| GitHub Pages | Push to `gh-pages` branch — free HTTPS included |
| Netlify | Drag & drop the folder — free HTTPS included |
| Vercel | `vercel deploy` — free HTTPS included |
| Synology NAS | See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) |
| Any static host | As long as HTTPS is available |

## 🔄 Cross-Device Sync (Optional)

The optional sync server keeps your artist lists in sync across all devices. It's a minimal Node.js HTTP server that stores lists in a JSON file — no database needed.

Setup with Docker in minutes. See [sync-server/SYNC-SERVER.md](sync-server/SYNC-SERVER.md).

```
Desktop (PWA)  ←→  Sync Server  ←→  Mobile (PWA)
```

## ⚠️ Spotify API Limitations

Music Shuffle targets **Development Mode** — free, no approval needed, personal use only.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Full discography shuffle | ✅ Works |
| Artist search | ✅ Works |
| Similar artists | ✅ Works |
| Web Playback (Premium required) | ✅ Works |
| Spotify Connect devices | ✅ Works |
| Audio features (energy, BPM) | ❌ Restricted in Dev Mode |
| User top tracks/artists | ❌ Restricted in Dev Mode |
| Max test users | ⚠️ 5 users (Dev Mode limit) |

Extended Quota (required to unlock restricted APIs) now requires 250,000 monthly active users and a registered business — effectively unavailable for personal projects.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No backend required** — all data stored in browser `localStorage`
- **No analytics, no tracking, no ads**
- **OAuth 2.0 PKCE** — most secure flow for public clients, no client secret needed
- `config.js` is in `.gitignore` — your Client ID never gets committed

## Credits

The idea, requirements and direction for this project came from **Jan Erik Mueller**.  
The entire codebase — every line of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the Spotify API wrapper, the OAuth PKCE flow, the PWA setup, the sync server — was written by **[Claude](https://claude.ai)**, an AI assistant made by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com).

This project is an example of human–AI collaboration: a person with a vision, and an AI that implements it.
