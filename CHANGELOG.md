# Changelog

All notable changes to Music Shuffle will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.2/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.6.3] — 2026-10-19 — New Logo

### Changed
- **New app logo "random equalizer"** — five bars of random height in Ember orange; the tallest one, the "picked" track, is off-white. Replaces the Sideforge "SF" monogram as app icon (the Sideforge logo next to the version stays).
- `favicon.svg` is a pixel-aligned 4-bar small version (32 px grid) so the browser tab stays sharp; `favicon.ico` contains a hand-tuned 16 px variant plus 32/48/256 px.
- App icons (`icons/icon-96/128/192/512.png`), maskable Android icons and `apple-touch-icon.png` regenerated with the 5-bar logo.
- Login page shows the new logo instead of the old teal vinyl/dice artwork from the Artist Shuffle days.

### Repository
- Sync server lives only in `sync-server/` now (`sync-server.js`, `Dockerfile` on `node:22-alpine`, `SYNC-SERVER.md`); the duplicate root `sync-server.js` and the outdated `node:18` Dockerfile are gone.
- `tests/` folder, `js/` modules, `favicon.ico` and the new icons added to the repo; `CLAUDE.md` with structure, test and release checklist.

---

## [1.6.2] — 2026-10-19 — New Icons

### Changed
- **All icons regenerated from the Sideforge "SF" logo** (`favicon.svg`): `favicon.ico` (16/32/48/256 px) and `icons/icon-96/128/192/512.png`. Previously `favicon.ico` and the PNG icons still showed the old Music Shuffle artwork.
- **Maskable icons** — new `icon-192-maskable.png` / `icon-512-maskable.png` (full-bleed, logo inside the 70 % safe zone) so Android's circle/squircle mask doesn't cut off the logo. The regular icons are now `purpose: "any"`.
- **iPhone home screen** — new full-bleed `icons/apple-touch-icon.png` (180 px); iOS rounds the corners itself.
- `manifest.json` background colour matches the icon (`#1A1A1A`).

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-10-19 — Tidied Up & Translated

### Changed
- **app.js split into modules** — the former 2,900-line `app.js` is now `app.js` (boot, login, event wiring, ~500 lines) plus `js/core.js`, `js/sync.js`, `js/player.js`, `js/shuffle.js`, `js/lists.js`, `js/ui.js` and `js/changelog.js`. Still plain scripts without a build step; load order is defined in `index.html`. Service worker and `Dockerfile` include the new `js/` folder.
- **Everything translated** — ~45 hard-coded German messages, tooltips and loading hints moved to `i18n.js` (DE/EN). `I18N.t()` now supports placeholders: `I18N.t('msg_list_created', { name })`.
- **Tooltips translated** — new `data-i18n-title` attribute for button tooltips in `index.html` (24 tooltips).
- **Language switch** re-renders all dynamic areas via the `langchange` event (previously only via the language button).
- Changelog section labels come from `i18n.js`.

### Fixed
- Album grid kept stale (hidden) cards after switching to a list without albums.

### Tests
- `L16` checks that every translation key used in the app exists in German **and** English; `U21` checks the English UI for leftover German text or raw keys.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-10-19 — Security & Auto-Reconnect

Security review from an attacker's point of view, maintainability clean-up, all findings covered by tests (15 logic, 11 sync server, 21 UI).

### Added
- **Automatic player reconnect** — when the browser freezes the tab (back/forward cache, energy saving), the Web Playback SDK loses its connection and Spotify drops the device. The app still held the old device ID, so the next track failed with `HTTP 404 Not found`. Now a 404 on our own device, a `pageshow` from the back/forward cache or a lasting `not_ready` reconnects the player, switches to the new device ID and retries the track.
- **Sync server login** — new env var `ALLOWED_USERS` (Spotify user IDs). The app sends its Spotify access token (`Authorization: Bearer …`); the server verifies it via `GET /v1/me` (cached 10 min, invalid tokens 1 min, max. 30 checks/min) and only lets allowed users in. Without `ALLOWED_USERS` the server stays open as before and logs a warning.
- **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** — CORS only for your own app URL (default `*` with warning).
- **Content Security Policy** (meta tag): scripts only from the app and `sdk.scdn.co`, no inline scripts, no plugins, `base-uri`/`form-action` locked. Plus referrer policy and a frame-buster against clickjacking.

### Changed
- **"Artist repeat after N tracks"** — the per-list setting existed in the UI but had no effect. It now keeps artists of the last N tracks (queue + history) out of the selection as long as other artists are available.
- **Shared selection logic** — shuffle button and queue used two copies of the pick logic (which is how Round Robin vs. Smart Shuffle drifted apart in 1.5.1). Now `chooseSource()` + `fetchTrackFor()` serve both.
- **Data validation** — lists from localStorage, the sync server and imported files go through `normalizeList()` (known fields only, Spotify IDs checked, lengths limited). Stats, blacklist and track history from the server are type-checked.
- **All sync requests** go through `SpotifyAPI.syncFetch()` (auth header, timeout, error handling in one place).
- **API errors** carry the HTTP status (`err.status`) instead of only a message string.
- **Sync server** — security headers (`nosniff`, `no-store`, `no-referrer`), Spotify IDs validated for cache/history keys (no `__proto__` or path tricks), invalid history entries are filtered. Public health only returns `status`, `version`, `auth`; counts need a login.
- **Docker** (`docker/sync-server.Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) — runs as user `node`, port bound to `127.0.0.1`, auth variables prepared.

### Fixed
- **Stored XSS** — image URLs and IDs from list data were inserted into HTML unescaped (`src="${img}"`, `data-id="${id}"`). Anyone able to write to the (previously unauthenticated) sync server could have run code in the app and read the Spotify refresh token. Now: URL allowlist (`https:`/same origin), escaping, inline `onerror` handlers replaced by one global listener, plus CSP.
- **Sync server crash (DoS)** — a single request with a malformed URL (e.g. `GET http://[`) threw outside the error handler and terminated the Node process.
- **Spotify IDs in API URLs** — IDs from list data are validated before being put into request paths.
- **List import** — imported lists with an existing ID silently replaced the existing list on the next sync; they now get a new ID.
- **Export** — object URL was revoked before the download could start in some browsers.
- `mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag added (console deprecation warning).

---

## [1.5.2] — 2026-10-10 — Code Review & Fairness

Full code review with automated tests (all findings fixed and re-tested).

### Added
- **"No commentary tracks" filter** — per-list filter that hides commentary tracks such as "The Nexus - Commentary" and whole commentary albums such as "The Nexus (Commentary)". Checks both track and album name.
- **Automated tests** (`tests/`) — `logic.test.js` (spotify-api.js in a Node VM with a mocked Spotify), `sync-server.test.js` (real server in a temp folder) and `ui.test.js` (whole app in headless Chromium with a fake Web Playback SDK). Run with `cd tests && npm install && npm test`. Not needed on the web server.
- **Health check** now also reports `trackHistory`, `albumCache`, `trackCache` and `version`.

### Changed
- **Song detection** — the same song released as a single *and* on an album (different Spotify IDs) now counts as one song: it no longer comes up twice as often, the album version is preferred, and the lock covers all versions.
- **Track selection with a cold cache** — instead of loading up to 25 albums (~29 requests ≈ 29 s) for one shuffle, albums are sampled weighted by track count and usually only 1–2 are loaded. Rejection sampling keeps every unplayed song equally likely.
- **Track status** — uses the cached/throttled API, the active list's filters and the same song detection as the shuffle (was: up to 20 uncached requests with `market=from_token`, filters ignored).
- **Service worker** — app shell (HTML/JS/CSS/JSON) is now network-first with offline fallback. After an update the new version loads automatically; clearing the service worker cache by hand is no longer necessary.
- **Sync server** — album/track cache kept in memory, expired entries (>24 h) pruned, tracks slimmed to the fields the app uses, cache files written compact; all files written atomically (temp file + rename). Empty album lists are rejected.
- **Client cache** — album and track objects are slimmed before caching (no `available_markets`, `href`, `external_urls` …).
- **Playlist from history** — uses `POST /me/playlists` and `POST /playlists/{id}/items` (the old endpoints were removed in Feb 2026). New OAuth scopes `playlist-modify-private`/`playlist-modify-public` → **log out and in once**.
- **Changelog dialog** renders "Removed" sections.

### Fixed
- **Immediate repeat lock** — the lock for shuffled/pre-queued tracks read `track.artistId`, which never existed, so it never applied. Tracks now carry `artistId` and `variantIds`.
- **Remove artist (✕)** — called a non-existent function (`removeArtistFromActiveList`) and threw a `ReferenceError`.
- **Failed album fetch cached** — a 403/429 while loading an artist's albums was cached as an empty list for 24 h and pushed to the sync server, making the artist "empty" on all devices.
- **Concurrent token refresh** — two parallel refreshes sent the same (rotated) refresh token; the second got `invalid_grant` and logged the user out. Refreshes are now shared.
- **Album blacklist** — was saved with `LS.save()` and never sent to `/api/blacklist`; also fetched with `market=from_token` past the cache.
- **Live filter** — matched "live" inside words (Deliverance, Alive, Olive …) and " live" in titles like "Born to Live Free". Now uses word boundaries.
- **Round Robin + Smart Shuffle** — the shuffle button ignored the Round Robin pick when Smart Shuffle was on.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — ignored modifier keys, so Ctrl+F/Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N triggered app actions; also inactive on the login screen now.
- **Login after failed callback** — the login button was not wired up when the OAuth callback failed.
- **Logout** — the silent media-key audio anchor kept playing after logout.
- **Album window tabs** — showed the raw i18n keys `tab_albums`/`tab_track_status`.
- **Artist placeholder image** — the inline `onerror` handler contained unescaped quotes (SyntaxError on every card without image).
- **Sync server** — `POST /api/track-history` accepted `history: null`; the request body is now size-limited.

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-19 — Shuffle Fairness & Genre Back

### Added
- **Genre shuffle re-enabled** — the Spotify search endpoint works again once the `limit` parameter respects the maximum of 10 that has applied since the February 2026 API changes. The earlier HTTP 400 `"Invalid limit"` error was caused solely by the old limit values (50/20), not by a catalog-access restriction. The genre search field, genre-based shuffling, the pool entry and the list counter are all back.

### Fixed
- **Shuffle fairness (main fix)** — individual songs were coming up far more often than others (e.g. one track 24×, others 1–2×). Root cause: `fillQueue` pre-loads tracks, but those tracks only entered the per-artist repeat lock (`artistTrackHistory`) when actually *played* — so the lock lagged behind and the same tracks could be drawn repeatedly across thousands of plays. Now every chosen track is added to the lock **immediately**, both on direct shuffle and when pre-filling the queue.
- **Even track selection** — `getRandomTrack` now pools all tracks from all candidate albums and picks uniformly, instead of picking an album first and then a track. The old approach over-weighted singles and short albums (a track on a single had a 100% chance once that single was picked, vs. 1/15 on a 15-track album).
- **Reset stats** — the "Reset stats" button now writes the emptied statistics to the sync server immediately. Previously the reset only cleared local state, so the old stats were reloaded from the server on the next app start.

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — now uses a fixed `DE` country code, because Spotify removed the `country` field from the `/me` response in February 2026 (the previous code read `me.country`, which no longer exists).

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-19 — Compact Menus & API Fixes

### Added
- **Compact list dropdown** — clicking the list name now opens a slim dropdown positioned right below it, instead of a full-width bottom sheet. Each entry shows its item count (artists + albums). Click outside to close.
- **Compact options menu** — the three-dot options button (rename, duplicate, merge, export, import, delete) now opens a compact right-aligned dropdown instead of a full-width sheet
- **Combined list counter** — the count next to the list name now includes both artists and albums (was artists only)

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — API requests now use the account's actual country code (fetched from `/me` and cached) instead of the deprecated `market=from_token`, which Spotify has begun rejecting with HTTP 400

### Removed
- **Genre shuffle** — Spotify has restricted track search (`type=track`) for Development Mode apps without Extended Quota. Requests return HTTP 400 with a misleading `"Invalid limit"` message; the real cause is missing catalog access for personal apps. As with the "Similar Artists" feature removed in v1.4.0, this is a deliberate Spotify platform restriction and cannot be fixed on our end. The genre search field and genre-based shuffling have been removed. Existing genre entries in lists are preserved as data but ignored.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-18 — Token Handling & Fixes

### Changed
- **Spotify refresh token expiry handling** — starting July 20, 2026, Spotify refresh tokens expire after 6 months. The app now detects the `invalid_grant` error on token refresh, discards the stored token without retrying, and redirects the user to sign in again. No data is lost — lists, stats, blacklist and track history all live on the sync server.

### Fixed
- **Artist card modal** — clicking an artist card opens the album/track-status modal again; it was blocked by leftover `discoverBtn` references from the Discovery removal in v1.4.0, which threw a JavaScript error on click
- **Progress bar thumb** — the draggable thumb now follows the playback position correctly instead of sticking to the right edge (CSS `right: 0` conflicted with the JS-set `left` value)

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-18 — Light Mode & Restore

### Added
- **Light mode** — full light theme using Sideforge Anvil palette; follows `prefers-color-scheme` automatically; manually overridable via 🌙/☀️ toggle button in the sidebar header; preference saved to `localStorage`
- **Last track restore** — the last played track (cover, title, artist, album, progress) is shown on app open after browser restart; pressing Play starts the track from the beginning
- **Clear track history button** — red 🗑️ History button in the Stats tab clears the entire `artistTrackHistory` immediately, both locally and on the sync server

### Changed
- **Player buttons** — hover state now shows Ember orange color + glow instead of gray background; applies to all control buttons (repeat, volume, blacklist, notifications, round robin, etc.)
- **Play/Pause button** — hover shows Ember orange; idle state is neutral (was always orange)
- **Sidebar** — right edge now has rounded corners (`border-radius: 0 var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0`)
- **Track artist and album name** below cover — switched from `var(--text2)`/`var(--text3)` to `var(--text)`/`var(--text2)` for better contrast in light mode

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-09 — Cache & History Release

### Added
- **Track status tab** in album browser — click an artist card and switch to the "📊 Track Status" tab to see all tracks with ✅ played or 🔒 locked status, plus a progress counter (e.g. "12 / 34 played")
- **Server-side track cache** — album track lists are now cached on the sync server (`/api/tracks`, `tracks.json`); after the first playthrough all track requests are served from cache — no more cold-start 429 errors
- **Track history sync** — the per-artist played-track history is synced across devices via the sync server (`/api/track-history`, `track-history.json`); merged on load so no plays are lost
- **Track history persistence** — `artistTrackHistory` is now saved to `localStorage` and survives browser restarts and page reloads
- **"No track repeats" filter** (per list) — toggle to enable/disable the artist track lock; when active, each track is only repeated after the full discography has been played; default: on
- **PWA icons updated** — all icon sizes (96, 128, 192, 512px) regenerated with the Sideforge SF monogram logo

### Changed
- **Discovery (Similar Artists) removed** — Spotify has permanently restricted the `/artists/{id}/related-artists` endpoint for Development Mode apps; the button, modal and all related code have been removed
- **Live filter** now also checks track names for unambiguous patterns (` live`, `(live`, `- live`, `live at `, `live in `) to catch tracks like "Song Title - Live, at Wacken 2015" without false positives on song titles containing the word "live"
- **`manifest.json` theme color** updated to Ember Orange `#E8600A` (was Spotify teal)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** — completely rewritten for current file structure including `sideforge-tokens.css`
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — completely rewritten; documents Sideforge Design System, all sync server endpoints, and known Spotify API limitations
- **SYNC-SERVER.md** — completely rewritten; documents all 6 data files and endpoints including new `/api/tracks` and `/api/track-history`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/tracks` — album track cache, stored in `tracks.json`
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/track-history` — per-artist played track history, stored in `track-history.json`

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-25 — Sideforge & Blacklist Sync

### Added
- **Sideforge Design System** — migrated from Spotify-green to the Sideforge Ember/Anvil palette; warm orange accents, warm grayscale backgrounds
- **Sideforge logo** (SF monogram) in sidebar header, left of the version button
- **Sideforge favicon** — SVG favicon with SF monogram replaces the vinyl+dice icon
- **Blacklist sync** — blacklisted tracks are now synced across all devices via the sync server (merged on load, 10s debounce on save)
- **Sync server `/api/blacklist`** — `GET` and `POST` endpoints, stored in `/data/blacklist.json`
- **Verdana UI font** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — replaces Syne + DM Sans; no webfont download, consistent look on Windows/macOS/Linux

### Changed
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; app works fully offline
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — now also returns `blacklist` count
- **Blacklist sync merge logic** — local entries not present on the server are preserved on load

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-25 — Sideforge v1.0.1 — Verdana

### Changed
- **Font migrated to Verdana** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — `Verdana, Geneva, "DejaVu Sans", Tahoma, sans-serif` replaces Syne + DM Sans across all UI elements
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; faster startup, works fully offline
- Logo font (Georgia italic bold) unchanged — intentional contrast, per Sideforge spec
- Mono areas (`font-family: monospace`) unchanged

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-22 — Album Blacklist

### Added
- **Album blacklist button** — new button in player secondary controls (💿, next to the track blacklist button) that adds all tracks of the currently playing album to the blacklist at once; shows a toast with the count of added tracks and skips to the next song automatically

### Fixed
- Album ID is now stored in `currentTrack` state — this was required for the album blacklist feature to work correctly

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22 — Filter & Shuffle Release

### Added
- **Acoustic filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "acoustic", "unplugged", "stripped", "acoustique", "akustik" in track or album name
- **Orchestral filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "orchestral" in track or album name
- **Artist repeat limit** — configurable per list: set how many tracks must play between repeats of the same artist (default: 3, range: 1–50)
- **Blacklist button in history** — 🚫 button directly on every history entry, no keyboard shortcut needed
- **Round Robin mode** — player button that cycles through all artists one by one in a randomly shuffled order; reshuffles when all artists have played once
- **Per-artist track lock** — tracks are never repeated for an artist until the entire discography has been played; auto-resets when exhausted

### Changed
- **Live filter** now checks track name in addition to album name — tracks like "Song - Live, at Wacken, 2015" are now correctly filtered (uses precise patterns like " live", "- live", "live at ", "live in " to avoid false positives on song titles containing "live")
- **Artist cooldown after Round Robin** — when Round Robin is deactivated, the last 5 played artists are locked for 5 songs to prevent immediate repeats
- **fillQueue in Round Robin** now uses the same shared artist queue and index as doShuffle — no more out-of-order artist picks in the pre-loaded queue

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-03 — Sync & Filter Release

### Added
- **Stats sync** — play statistics (plays, shuffle count) are now stored on the sync server and shared across all devices
- **Server-side album cache** — Spotify album data is cached on the sync server after the first fetch; subsequent app starts load from cache instead of hitting the Spotify API (24h TTL, eliminates cold-start 429 errors)
- **Instrumental filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks containing "instrumental", "karaoke", "backing track", "playback", "(inst" or "inst." in the track name
- **`syncStats` config flag** — set `syncStats: false` in `config.js` to keep play statistics local even when a sync server is configured

### Changed
- **Spotify 429 handling** — up to 3 retries (was 1) with full `Retry-After` wait between each attempt
- **Rate limit recovery** — after exhausting retries, app automatically retries shuffle after 35 seconds instead of stopping playback silently
- **`fillQueue` delay** — increased from 5s to 20s after first track to give server cache time to load on startup
- **Stats sync debounce** — stats are synced to server 30 seconds after the last play (not per song, not tied to list sync)
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — response now includes `plays` count in addition to `lists`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET /api/stats` — load play statistics
- New endpoint `POST /api/stats` — save play statistics
- New endpoint `GET /api/cache` — load full album cache
- New endpoint `POST /api/cache` — store single artist album cache entry
- New data files: `stats.json`, `cache.json` (separate from `lists.json`)

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-29 — Cleanup & Balance Release

### Added
- Artist section header with count — "🎤 Künstler (31)" above artist grid
- Album section now shows count — "🎵 Alben (2)"
- Section headers switch language with DE/EN toggle

### Changed
- Artist pool weight increased to 3× vs albums (1×) — prevents single albums from dominating shuffle
- Complete code rewrite — app.js reduced from 3039 to ~1900 lines (−37%)
- spotify-api.js reduced from 651 to 300 lines (−54%)
- Startup API calls delayed to reduce 429 rate limiting on page load
- Device auto-refresh every 2 minutes (was 30 seconds)
- Player state polling every 15 seconds (was 5 seconds)

### Fixed
- fillQueue referenced undefined variable — next track now always works
- duplicateActiveList now correctly copies albums
- Dead code removed (Like section, unused functions)
- Sync helper consolidated into single request method

---

- **"No track repeats" filter** (per list) — toggle to enable/disable the artist track lock; when active, each track is only repeated after the full discography has been played; default: on
- **PWA icons updated** — all icon sizes (96, 128, 192, 512px) regenerated with the Sideforge SF monogram logo

### Changed
- **Discovery (Similar Artists) removed** — Spotify has permanently restricted the `/artists/{id}/related-artists` endpoint for Development Mode apps; the button, modal and all related code have been removed
- **Live filter** now also checks track names for unambiguous patterns (` live`, `(live`, `- live`, `live at `, `live in `) to catch tracks like "Song Title - Live, at Wacken 2015" without false positives on song titles containing the word "live"
- **`manifest.json` theme color** updated to Ember Orange `#E8600A` (was Spotify teal)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** — completely rewritten for current file structure including `sideforge-tokens.css`
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — completely rewritten; documents Sideforge Design System, all sync server endpoints, and known Spotify API limitations
- **SYNC-SERVER.md** — completely rewritten; documents all 6 data files and endpoints including new `/api/tracks` and `/api/track-history`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/tracks` — album track cache, stored in `tracks.json`
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/track-history` — per-artist played track history, stored in `track-history.json`

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-04-25 — Sideforge & Blacklist Sync

### Added
- **Sideforge Design System** — migrated from Spotify-green to the Sideforge Ember/Anvil palette; warm orange accents, warm grayscale backgrounds
- **Sideforge logo** (SF monogram) in sidebar header, left of the version button
- **Sideforge favicon** — SVG favicon with SF monogram replaces the vinyl+dice icon
- **Blacklist sync** — blacklisted tracks are now synced across all devices via the sync server (merged on load, 10s debounce on save)
- **Sync server `/api/blacklist`** — `GET` and `POST` endpoints, stored in `/data/blacklist.json`
- **Verdana UI font** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — replaces Syne + DM Sans; no webfont download, consistent look on Windows/macOS/Linux

### Changed
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; app works fully offline
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — now also returns `blacklist` count
- **Blacklist sync merge logic** — local entries not present on the server are preserved on load

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-25 — Sideforge v1.0.1 — Verdana

### Changed
- **Font migrated to Verdana** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — `Verdana, Geneva, "DejaVu Sans", Tahoma, sans-serif` replaces Syne + DM Sans across all UI elements
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; faster startup, works fully offline
- Logo font (Georgia italic bold) unchanged — intentional contrast, per Sideforge spec
- Mono areas (`font-family: monospace`) unchanged

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-22 — Album Blacklist

### Added
- **Album blacklist button** — new button in player secondary controls (💿, next to the track blacklist button) that adds all tracks of the currently playing album to the blacklist at once; shows a toast with the count of added tracks and skips to the next song automatically

### Fixed
- Album ID is now stored in `currentTrack` state — this was required for the album blacklist feature to work correctly

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22 — Filter & Shuffle Release

### Added
- **Acoustic filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "acoustic", "unplugged", "stripped", "acoustique", "akustik" in track or album name
- **Orchestral filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "orchestral" in track or album name
- **Artist repeat limit** — configurable per list: set how many tracks must play between repeats of the same artist (default: 3, range: 1–50)
- **Blacklist button in history** — 🚫 button directly on every history entry, no keyboard shortcut needed
- **Round Robin mode** — player button that cycles through all artists one by one in a randomly shuffled order; reshuffles when all artists have played once
- **Per-artist track lock** — tracks are never repeated for an artist until the entire discography has been played; auto-resets when exhausted

### Changed
- **Live filter** now checks track name in addition to album name — tracks like "Song - Live, at Wacken, 2015" are now correctly filtered (uses precise patterns like " live", "- live", "live at ", "live in " to avoid false positives on song titles containing "live")
- **Artist cooldown after Round Robin** — when Round Robin is deactivated, the last 5 played artists are locked for 5 songs to prevent immediate repeats
- **fillQueue in Round Robin** now uses the same shared artist queue and index as doShuffle — no more out-of-order artist picks in the pre-loaded queue

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-03 — Sync & Filter Release

### Added
- **Stats sync** — play statistics (plays, shuffle count) are now stored on the sync server and shared across all devices
- **Server-side album cache** — Spotify album data is cached on the sync server after the first fetch; subsequent app starts load from cache instead of hitting the Spotify API (24h TTL, eliminates cold-start 429 errors)
- **Instrumental filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks containing "instrumental", "karaoke", "backing track", "playback", "(inst" or "inst." in the track name
- **`syncStats` config flag** — set `syncStats: false` in `config.js` to keep play statistics local even when a sync server is configured

### Changed
- **Spotify 429 handling** — up to 3 retries (was 1) with full `Retry-After` wait between each attempt
- **Rate limit recovery** — after exhausting retries, app automatically retries shuffle after 35 seconds instead of stopping playback silently
- **`fillQueue` delay** — increased from 5s to 20s after first track to give server cache time to load on startup
- **Stats sync debounce** — stats are synced to server 30 seconds after the last play (not per song, not tied to list sync)
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — response now includes `plays` count in addition to `lists`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET /api/stats` — load play statistics
- New endpoint `POST /api/stats` — save play statistics
- New endpoint `GET /api/cache` — load full album cache
- New endpoint `POST /api/cache` — store single artist album cache entry
- New data files: `stats.json`, `cache.json` (separate from `lists.json`)

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-29 — Bugfix Release

### Fixed
- Shuffle now truly random across all sources — artists, albums and genres in one equal pool
- Albums-only lists now work correctly (no "no artists" error)
- Skip now instant when queue has tracks — no delay
- Empty queue falls back to direct shuffle instead of waiting

### Changed
- Each artist and album has equal chance of being picked (1 entry each in pool)
- Artists with more albums naturally provide more variety when selected
- Smart Shuffle still applies — artists not played recently get higher weight

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-19 — Shuffle Fairness & Genre Back

### Added
- **Genre shuffle re-enabled** — the Spotify search endpoint works again once the `limit` parameter respects the maximum of 10 that has applied since the February 2026 API changes. The earlier HTTP 400 `"Invalid limit"` error was caused solely by the old limit values (50/20), not by a catalog-access restriction. The genre search field, genre-based shuffling, the pool entry and the list counter are all back.

### Fixed
- **Shuffle fairness (main fix)** — individual songs were coming up far more often than others (e.g. one track 24×, others 1–2×). Root cause: `fillQueue` pre-loads tracks, but those tracks only entered the per-artist repeat lock (`artistTrackHistory`) when actually *played* — so the lock lagged behind and the same tracks could be drawn repeatedly across thousands of plays. Now every chosen track is added to the lock **immediately**, both on direct shuffle and when pre-filling the queue.
- **Even track selection** — `getRandomTrack` now pools all tracks from all candidate albums and picks uniformly, instead of picking an album first and then a track. The old approach over-weighted singles and short albums (a track on a single had a 100% chance once that single was picked, vs. 1/15 on a 15-track album).
- **Reset stats** — the "Reset stats" button now writes the emptied statistics to the sync server immediately. Previously the reset only cleared local state, so the old stats were reloaded from the server on the next app start.

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — now uses a fixed `DE` country code, because Spotify removed the `country` field from the `/me` response in February 2026 (the previous code read `me.country`, which no longer exists).

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-19 — Compact Menus & API Fixes

### Added
- **Compact list dropdown** — clicking the list name now opens a slim dropdown positioned right below it, instead of a full-width bottom sheet. Each entry shows its item count (artists + albums). Click outside to close.
- **Compact options menu** — the three-dot options button (rename, duplicate, merge, export, import, delete) now opens a compact right-aligned dropdown instead of a full-width sheet
- **Combined list counter** — the count next to the list name now includes both artists and albums (was artists only)

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — API requests now use the account's actual country code (fetched from `/me` and cached) instead of the deprecated `market=from_token`, which Spotify has begun rejecting with HTTP 400

### Removed
- **Genre shuffle** — Spotify has restricted track search (`type=track`) for Development Mode apps without Extended Quota. Requests return HTTP 400 with a misleading `"Invalid limit"` message; the real cause is missing catalog access for personal apps. As with the "Similar Artists" feature removed in v1.4.0, this is a deliberate Spotify platform restriction and cannot be fixed on our end. The genre search field and genre-based shuffling have been removed. Existing genre entries in lists are preserved as data but ignored.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-18 — Token Handling & Fixes

### Changed
- **Spotify refresh token expiry handling** — starting July 20, 2026, Spotify refresh tokens expire after 6 months. The app now detects the `invalid_grant` error on token refresh, discards the stored token without retrying, and redirects the user to sign in again. No data is lost — lists, stats, blacklist and track history all live on the sync server.

### Fixed
- **Artist card modal** — clicking an artist card opens the album/track-status modal again; it was blocked by leftover `discoverBtn` references from the Discovery removal in v1.4.0, which threw a JavaScript error on click
- **Progress bar thumb** — the draggable thumb now follows the playback position correctly instead of sticking to the right edge (CSS `right: 0` conflicted with the JS-set `left` value)

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-18 — Light Mode & Restore

### Added
- **Light mode** — full light theme using Sideforge Anvil palette; follows `prefers-color-scheme` automatically; manually overridable via 🌙/☀️ toggle button in the sidebar header; preference saved to `localStorage`
- **Last track restore** — the last played track (cover, title, artist, album, progress) is shown on app open after browser restart; pressing Play starts the track from the beginning
- **Clear track history button** — red 🗑️ History button in the Stats tab clears the entire `artistTrackHistory` immediately, both locally and on the sync server

### Changed
- **Player buttons** — hover state now shows Ember orange color + glow instead of gray background; applies to all control buttons (repeat, volume, blacklist, notifications, round robin, etc.)
- **Play/Pause button** — hover shows Ember orange; idle state is neutral (was always orange)
- **Sidebar** — right edge now has rounded corners (`border-radius: 0 var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0`)
- **Track artist and album name** below cover — switched from `var(--text2)`/`var(--text3)` to `var(--text)`/`var(--text2)` for better contrast in light mode

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-09 — Cache & History Release

### Added
- **Track status tab** in album browser — click an artist card and switch to the "📊 Track Status" tab to see all tracks with ✅ played or 🔒 locked status, plus a progress counter (e.g. "12 / 34 played")
- **Server-side track cache** — album track lists are now cached on the sync server (`/api/tracks`, `tracks.json`); after the first playthrough all track requests are served from cache — no more cold-start 429 errors
- **Track history sync** — the per-artist played-track history is synced across devices via the sync server (`/api/track-history`, `track-history.json`); merged on load so no plays are lost
- **Track history persistence** — `artistTrackHistory` is now saved to `localStorage` and survives browser restarts and page reloads
- **"No track repeats" filter** (per list) — toggle to enable/disable the artist track lock; when active, each track is only repeated after the full discography has been played; default: on

- **`manifest.json` theme color** updated to Ember Orange `#E8600A` (was Spotify teal)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** — completely rewritten for current file structure including `sideforge-tokens.css`
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — completely rewritten; documents Sideforge Design System, all sync server endpoints, and known Spotify API limitations
- **SYNC-SERVER.md** — completely rewritten; documents all 6 data files and endpoints including new `/api/tracks` and `/api/track-history`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/tracks` — album track cache, stored in `tracks.json`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22 — Filter & Shuffle Release

### Added
- **Acoustic filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "acoustic", "unplugged", "stripped", "acoustique", "akustik" in track or album name
- **Orchestral filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "orchestral" in track or album name
- **Artist repeat limit** — configurable per list: set how many tracks must play between repeats of the same artist (default: 3, range: 1–50)
- **Blacklist button in history** — 🚫 button directly on every history entry, no keyboard shortcut needed
- **Round Robin mode** — player button that cycles through all artists one by one in a randomly shuffled order; reshuffles when all artists have played once
- **Per-artist track lock** — tracks are never repeated for an artist until the entire discography has been played; auto-resets when exhausted

### Changed
- **Live filter** now checks track name in addition to album name — tracks like "Song - Live, at Wacken, 2015" are now correctly filtered (uses precise patterns like " live", "- live", "live at ", "live in " to avoid false positives on song titles containing "live")
- **Artist cooldown after Round Robin** — when Round Robin is deactivated, the last 5 played artists are locked for 5 songs to prevent immediate repeats
- **fillQueue in Round Robin** now uses the same shared artist queue and index as doShuffle — no more out-of-order artist picks in the pre-loaded queue

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-03 — Sync & Filter Release

### Added
- **Stats sync** — play statistics (plays, shuffle count) are now stored on the sync server and shared across all devices
- **Server-side album cache** — Spotify album data is cached on the sync server after the first fetch; subsequent app starts load from cache instead of hitting the Spotify API (24h TTL, eliminates cold-start 429 errors)
- **Instrumental filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks containing "instrumental", "karaoke", "backing track", "playback", "(inst" or "inst." in the track name
- **`syncStats` config flag** — set `syncStats: false` in `config.js` to keep play statistics local even when a sync server is configured

### Changed
- **Spotify 429 handling** — up to 3 retries (was 1) with full `Retry-After` wait between each attempt
- **Rate limit recovery** — after exhausting retries, app automatically retries shuffle after 35 seconds instead of stopping playback silently
- **`fillQueue` delay** — increased from 5s to 20s after first track to give server cache time to load on startup
- **Stats sync debounce** — stats are synced to server 30 seconds after the last play (not per song, not tied to list sync)
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — response now includes `plays` count in addition to `lists`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET /api/stats` — load play statistics
- New endpoint `POST /api/stats` — save play statistics
- New endpoint `GET /api/cache` — load full album cache
- New endpoint `POST /api/cache` — store single artist album cache entry
- New data files: `stats.json`, `cache.json` (separate from `lists.json`)

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-27 — Bugfix Release

### Added
- Artist grid now sorted alphabetically

### Changed
- Artist grid switched from 3 to 2 columns — larger images, more breathing room

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-19 — Shuffle Fairness & Genre Back

### Added
- **Genre shuffle re-enabled** — the Spotify search endpoint works again once the `limit` parameter respects the maximum of 10 that has applied since the February 2026 API changes. The earlier HTTP 400 `"Invalid limit"` error was caused solely by the old limit values (50/20), not by a catalog-access restriction. The genre search field, genre-based shuffling, the pool entry and the list counter are all back.

### Fixed
- **Shuffle fairness (main fix)** — individual songs were coming up far more often than others (e.g. one track 24×, others 1–2×). Root cause: `fillQueue` pre-loads tracks, but those tracks only entered the per-artist repeat lock (`artistTrackHistory`) when actually *played* — so the lock lagged behind and the same tracks could be drawn repeatedly across thousands of plays. Now every chosen track is added to the lock **immediately**, both on direct shuffle and when pre-filling the queue.
- **Even track selection** — `getRandomTrack` now pools all tracks from all candidate albums and picks uniformly, instead of picking an album first and then a track. The old approach over-weighted singles and short albums (a track on a single had a 100% chance once that single was picked, vs. 1/15 on a 15-track album).
- **Reset stats** — the "Reset stats" button now writes the emptied statistics to the sync server immediately. Previously the reset only cleared local state, so the old stats were reloaded from the server on the next app start.

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — now uses a fixed `DE` country code, because Spotify removed the `country` field from the `/me` response in February 2026 (the previous code read `me.country`, which no longer exists).

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-19 — Compact Menus & API Fixes

### Added
- **Compact list dropdown** — clicking the list name now opens a slim dropdown positioned right below it, instead of a full-width bottom sheet. Each entry shows its item count (artists + albums). Click outside to close.
- **Compact options menu** — the three-dot options button (rename, duplicate, merge, export, import, delete) now opens a compact right-aligned dropdown instead of a full-width sheet
- **Combined list counter** — the count next to the list name now includes both artists and albums (was artists only)

### Changed
- **`market` parameter** — API requests now use the account's actual country code (fetched from `/me` and cached) instead of the deprecated `market=from_token`, which Spotify has begun rejecting with HTTP 400

### Removed
- **Genre shuffle** — Spotify has restricted track search (`type=track`) for Development Mode apps without Extended Quota. Requests return HTTP 400 with a misleading `"Invalid limit"` message; the real cause is missing catalog access for personal apps. As with the "Similar Artists" feature removed in v1.4.0, this is a deliberate Spotify platform restriction and cannot be fixed on our end. The genre search field and genre-based shuffling have been removed. Existing genre entries in lists are preserved as data but ignored.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-18 — Token Handling & Fixes

### Changed
- **Spotify refresh token expiry handling** — starting July 20, 2026, Spotify refresh tokens expire after 6 months. The app now detects the `invalid_grant` error on token refresh, discards the stored token without retrying, and redirects the user to sign in again. No data is lost — lists, stats, blacklist and track history all live on the sync server.

### Fixed
- **Artist card modal** — clicking an artist card opens the album/track-status modal again; it was blocked by leftover `discoverBtn` references from the Discovery removal in v1.4.0, which threw a JavaScript error on click
- **Progress bar thumb** — the draggable thumb now follows the playback position correctly instead of sticking to the right edge (CSS `right: 0` conflicted with the JS-set `left` value)

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-18 — Light Mode & Restore

### Added
- **Light mode** — full light theme using Sideforge Anvil palette; follows `prefers-color-scheme` automatically; manually overridable via 🌙/☀️ toggle button in the sidebar header; preference saved to `localStorage`
- **Last track restore** — the last played track (cover, title, artist, album, progress) is shown on app open after browser restart; pressing Play starts the track from the beginning
- **Clear track history button** — red 🗑️ History button in the Stats tab clears the entire `artistTrackHistory` immediately, both locally and on the sync server

### Changed
- **Player buttons** — hover state now shows Ember orange color + glow instead of gray background; applies to all control buttons (repeat, volume, blacklist, notifications, round robin, etc.)
- **Play/Pause button** — hover shows Ember orange; idle state is neutral (was always orange)
- **Sidebar** — right edge now has rounded corners (`border-radius: 0 var(--radius-lg) var(--radius-lg) 0`)
- **Track artist and album name** below cover — switched from `var(--text2)`/`var(--text3)` to `var(--text)`/`var(--text2)` for better contrast in light mode

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-09 — Cache & History Release

### Added
- **Track status tab** in album browser — click an artist card and switch to the "📊 Track Status" tab to see all tracks with ✅ played or 🔒 locked status, plus a progress counter (e.g. "12 / 34 played")
- **Server-side track cache** — album track lists are now cached on the sync server (`/api/tracks`, `tracks.json`); after the first playthrough all track requests are served from cache — no more cold-start 429 errors
- **Track history sync** — the per-artist played-track history is synced across devices via the sync server (`/api/track-history`, `track-history.json`); merged on load so no plays are lost
- **Track history persistence** — `artistTrackHistory` is now saved to `localStorage` and survives browser restarts and page reloads
- **"No track repeats" filter** (per list) — toggle to enable/disable the artist track lock; when active, each track is only repeated after the full discography has been played; default: on
- **PWA icons updated** — all icon sizes (96, 128, 192, 512px) regenerated with the Sideforge SF monogram logo

### Changed
- **Discovery (Similar Artists) removed** — Spotify has permanently restricted the `/artists/{id}/related-artists` endpoint for Development Mode apps; the button, modal and all related code have been removed
- **Live filter** now also checks track names for unambiguous patterns (` live`, `(live`, `- live`, `live at `, `live in `) to catch tracks like "Song Title - Live, at Wacken 2015" without false positives on song titles containing the word "live"
- **`manifest.json` theme color** updated to Ember Orange `#E8600A` (was Spotify teal)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** — completely rewritten for current file structure including `sideforge-tokens.css`
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — completely rewritten; documents Sideforge Design System, all sync server endpoints, and known Spotify API limitations
- **SYNC-SERVER.md** — completely rewritten; documents all 6 data files and endpoints including new `/api/tracks` and `/api/track-history`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/tracks` — album track cache, stored in `tracks.json`
- New endpoint `GET/POST /api/track-history` — per-artist played track history, stored in `track-history.json`

---

- **Sync server `/api/blacklist`** — `GET` and `POST` endpoints, stored in `/data/blacklist.json`
- **Verdana UI font** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — replaces Syne + DM Sans; no webfont download, consistent look on Windows/macOS/Linux

### Changed
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; app works fully offline
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — now also returns `blacklist` count
- **Blacklist sync merge logic** — local entries not present on the server are preserved on load

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-04-25 — Sideforge v1.0.1 — Verdana

### Changed
- **Font migrated to Verdana** (Sideforge Design System v1.0.1) — `Verdana, Geneva, "DejaVu Sans", Tahoma, sans-serif` replaces Syne + DM Sans across all UI elements
- **Google Fonts removed** — no more external font requests on page load; faster startup, works fully offline
- Logo font (Georgia italic bold) unchanged — intentional contrast, per Sideforge spec

### Fixed

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22 — Filter & Shuffle Release
