# Changelog

All notable changes to Music Shuffle will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.2/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-22 — Album Blacklist

### Added
- **Album blacklist button** — new button in player secondary controls (💿, next to the track blacklist button) that adds all tracks of the currently playing album to the blacklist at once; shows a toast with the count of added tracks and skips to the next song automatically

### Fixed
- Album ID is now stored in `currentTrack` state — this was required for the album blacklist feature to work correctly

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-22 — Filter & Shuffle Release

### Added
- **Acoustic filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "acoustic", "unplugged", "stripped", "acoustique", "akustik" in track or album name
- **Orchestral filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks with "orchestral" in track or album name
- **Artist repeat limit** — configurable per list: set how many tracks must play between repeats of the same artist (default: 3, range: 1–50)
- **Blacklist button in history** — 🚫 button directly on every history entry, no keyboard shortcut needed
- **Round Robin mode** — player button that cycles through all artists one by one in a randomly shuffled order; reshuffles when all artists have played once
- **Per-artist track lock** — tracks are never repeated for an artist until the entire discography has been played; auto-resets when exhausted

### Changed
- **Live filter** now checks track name in addition to album name — tracks like "Song - Live, at Wacken, 2015" are now correctly filtered (uses precise patterns like " live", "- live", "live at ", "live in " to avoid false positives on song titles containing "live")
- **Artist cooldown after Round Robin** — when Round Robin is deactivated, the last 5 played artists are locked for 5 songs to prevent immediate repeats
- **fillQueue in Round Robin** now uses the same shared artist queue and index as doShuffle — no more out-of-order artist picks in the pre-loaded queue

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-03 — Sync & Filter Release

### Added
- **Stats sync** — play statistics (plays, shuffle count) are now stored on the sync server and shared across all devices
- **Server-side album cache** — Spotify album data is cached on the sync server after the first fetch; subsequent app starts load from cache instead of hitting the Spotify API (24h TTL, eliminates cold-start 429 errors)
- **Instrumental filter** — per-list toggle to hide tracks containing "instrumental", "karaoke", "backing track", "playback", "(inst" or "inst." in the track name
- **`syncStats` config flag** — set `syncStats: false` in `config.js` to keep play statistics local even when a sync server is configured

### Changed
- **Spotify 429 handling** — up to 3 retries (was 1) with full `Retry-After` wait between each attempt
- **Rate limit recovery** — after exhausting retries, app automatically retries shuffle after 35 seconds instead of stopping playback silently
- **`fillQueue` delay** — increased from 5s to 20s after first track to give server cache time to load on startup
- **Stats sync debounce** — stats are synced to server 30 seconds after the last play (not per song, not tied to list sync)
- **Sync server `/api/health`** — response now includes `plays` count in addition to `lists`

### Sync Server
- New endpoint `GET /api/stats` — load play statistics
- New endpoint `POST /api/stats` — save play statistics
- New endpoint `GET /api/cache` — load full album cache
- New endpoint `POST /api/cache` — store single artist album cache entry
- New data files: `stats.json`, `cache.json` (separate from `lists.json`)

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-29 — Cleanup & Balance Release

### Added
- Artist section header with count — "🎤 Künstler (31)" above artist grid
- Album section now shows count — "🎵 Alben (2)"
- Section headers switch language with DE/EN toggle

### Changed
- Artist pool weight increased to 3× vs albums (1×) — prevents single albums from dominating shuffle
- Complete code rewrite — app.js reduced from 3039 to ~1900 lines (−37%)
- spotify-api.js reduced from 651 to 300 lines (−54%)
- Startup API calls delayed to reduce 429 rate limiting on page load
- Device auto-refresh every 2 minutes (was 30 seconds)
- Player state polling every 15 seconds (was 5 seconds)

### Fixed
- fillQueue referenced undefined variable — next track now always works
- duplicateActiveList now correctly copies albums
- Dead code removed (Like section, unused functions)
- Sync helper consolidated into single request method
